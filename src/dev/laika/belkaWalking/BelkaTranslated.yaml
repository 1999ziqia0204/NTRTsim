# This is a placeholder for moving around the final Belka model,
# so that the path can be hard-coded in the App file.
# Will orient the robot with the vertical axis z=0 aligned with the center of the vertebrae, then translate vertically
# that distance should be a total of 27.5 cm, plus a fudge factor. The ground is 1.5 units above zero, actually, so... +1.6=29.1
