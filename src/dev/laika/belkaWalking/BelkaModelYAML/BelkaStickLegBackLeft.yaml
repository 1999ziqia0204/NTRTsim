# Units are currently in cm
# This file defines one leg, as a "stick."
# It will be one long box with a ball at its foot,
# like the legs on the current Laika.
# We need to name the legs differently so we can add the hinges correctly
# to each of them. Legs are the same modulo their names.

nodes:
  # Second vertex is the endpoint. 
  # From MATLAB statics, leg is 27.5 cm high.
  # But, to visualize this by itself, put the start of the leg "up".
  # If we want to have a r=3cm radius ball at the bottom, legtop should be total_h - 3cm = 24.5cm
  legtop: [0, 24.5, 0]
