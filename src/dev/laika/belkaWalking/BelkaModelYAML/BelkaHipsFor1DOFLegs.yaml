# Units are now in decimeters (scaling all up by a factor of 10.)
# These hips are just one box.
# NOTE that these can be used for both legs on one end, but need to use a
# different file for the shoulders and for the hips.
# That's because we couldn't differentiate between which shoulder/hips otherwise
# when applying the btHingeConstraint.
# Procedure for hinged legs: create a btHingeConstraint between the center point
# 	    of one of the hipsBack rods. This can be the same constraint for
#	    both legs, since it doesn't really matter the distance between
#	    the rigid bodies. We'll be "applying a torque" between each leg
#	    and the center of the hips, but that should be OK... right?

nodes:
  # first two are the base connection for the hips
  # the hips frame is 19.2cm away from the center of its closest vertebra
  V1: [0, 0, 0]   
  V2: [1.92, 0, 0]
  # second two are the two endpoints of the "T"
  # the legs are 17.8cm away from the centerline
  V3: [1.92, 0, 1.78]
  V4: [1.92, 0, -1.78]
