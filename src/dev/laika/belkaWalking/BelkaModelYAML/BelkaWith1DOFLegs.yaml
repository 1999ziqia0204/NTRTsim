# YAML file for Laika with movable legs.
# This file MUST be used with BelkaWalkingModel, not with TensegrityModel.
# Otherwise, the legs will not be attached to the hips: TensegrityModel does
# add the btHingeConstraints that are needed.

# This spine has multiple substructures,
# including the spine itself (t1-5) and the supporting pieces.
# NOTE that this model has vertical axis z=0 aligned with center of vertebra, 
# you MUST translate it upward by at least 27.5cm!

# Notes: tetrahedron are offset by the bar endpoint length (14.2cm)
# The shoulders are aligned exactly with the first vertebra already

substructures:

  t1/t2/t3/t4/t5:
    path: ./BelkaTetrahedronSymmetric.yaml
    offset: [-14.2, 0 , 0]
    translation: [0, 0, 0]
    
  hips:
    path: ./BelkaHipsFor1DOFLegs.yaml
    offset: [0, 0, 0]
    translation: [0, 0.0, 0]

  # Hips translation was 0, 40.5, 0

  # Previously, we just swapped around the hips:
  #front:
  #  path: ../BaseStructuresLaika/HipsFor1DOFLegs.yaml
  #  offset: [0, 0, 0]
  #  translation: [-60, 40.5, 0] # 68
  #  rotation:
  #    axis: [0, 1, 0]
  #    angle: 180
  #    reference: [0, 0, 0]

  # ...but now, we need to use separate shoulders, so we can have
  # different tags for the rods that will be used for the hinges.
  # With 5 vertebra, and shoulders rotated around their (0,0) of the vertebra center, 4*offset = 56.8
  front:
    path: ./BelkaShouldersFor1DOFLegs.yaml
    offset: [0, 0, 0]
    translation: [-56.8, 0, 0]
    rotation:
      axis: [0, 1, 0]
      angle: 180
      reference: [0, 0, 0]

  # However, now we need to have each leg separate. This is required for us
  # to be able to pick out the tags for the btHingeConstraints.
  # Legs need to be stuck downwards. With their origin at (0,0,0), leg top is +24.5, bottom of sphere foot is -3.
  # Legs are 19.2cm from the vertebra-to-hip/shoulder connection point (along longitudinal axis), and 17.8+fudge from centerline
