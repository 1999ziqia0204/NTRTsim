# The TwoSegSpine is a spine with two vertebrae.

# Two Tetrahedron structures.
substructures:
  tA:
    path: ./RotVertSplitA.yaml
    translation: [ -2, 35.5, 8]
    scale: 1
  tB:
    path: ./RotVertSplitB.yaml
    translation: [ -7, 35.5, 8]
    scale: 1

# The original TetrahedralSpineWithRotJoint had translated this yaml
# file: [ -2, 35.5, 8]
# So, the original tA becomes [ -2, 35.5, 8], and tB becomes [ -7, 35.5, 8]
# [0, 0, 0], [-5, 0, 0]

# NOTE that as of 2018-02-10, the vertebrae are now centered at the origin,
# NOT at some z-displacement!!!
