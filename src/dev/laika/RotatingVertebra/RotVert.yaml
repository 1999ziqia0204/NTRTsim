# This YAML file represents a single vertebra,
# made out of two pieces that rotate with respect
# to each other. Note that it does NOT include the hinge joint
# as of 2017-02-26, that has to be created in an app or somewhere else.

# The front and back parts of the vertebra:
substructures:
  back:
    path: ./RotVertBack.yaml
    translation: [7, 20, 0] # only a small translation need, so no collisions.
  front:
    path: ./RotVertFront.yaml
    translation: [-7, 20, 0] # only a small translation need, so no collisions.

# This single vertebra does not have any cables, so that's it.
