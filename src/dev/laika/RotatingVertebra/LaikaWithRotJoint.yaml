  #rod: 

# Rod radius reduced to half for tests at 0.5 scale.
# Mass calculations: Robot weighed 1.62 kg on 2016-09-09,
# 1.62 * 9.81 = 15.9 N
# Rod density changed from 0.014 to 0.0044.
# For the saddle cables, spring constant is 7 lb/in = 1226 N/m
# (was either 1000 or 5000)
# For the horizontal cables, spring constant is 1.07 lb/in = 187 N/m
# (was 5000)
# Lowered friction from 1 to 0.5.
