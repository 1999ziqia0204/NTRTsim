Welcome to the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit Introduction Seminar!

This text file accompanies the seminar held on Wednesday Sept. 28th 2016 of NTRTsim, as given in the Berkeley Emergent Space Tensegrities Lab.

This seminar is designed to give new NTRT users a basic idea of how the simulator works, and how to build/run applications. For more information about any specific C++ classes, see the Doxygen documentation (http://ntrt.perryb.ca/doxygen/), and for more information about the YAML functionality, see the tutorials (http://ntrtsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

----------------------------------

Outline: 

(i) Preliminary: Navigating the Linux Command Line
    - cd, ls, pwd, running executables, terminal colors

1. Switch to the NTRT_Intro branch, open this file.
   - (what 'skeleton' means, for this seminar.)
   - "FILL_IN"
2. Basic Usage (build, run example.)
3. Documentation location, keyboard commands
4. 4 Components of your program in NTRTsim:
   - App
   - Model
   - Controller (optional)
   - Other supporting files (such as CMakeLists)

5. Apps, Models, Controllers for NTRTsim v1.0 (Traditional) - Creating Models in C++
5.1 Run App3bar. What happens?
5.2. Fill in a line in threeBarModel.cpp
     - The actuator should connect nodes 5 and 3, and be labelled actuator num 5
5.3 Build, run App3bar. Looks better!
5.4 Fill in a line in App3bar.cpp.
    - The name of the controller "class" is LengthController
5.5 Build, run App3bar. Wait, we expected the structure to move? What's wrong?
5.6 Type this line into App3bar.cpp:
    myModel->attach(myController);
5.7 Build, run App3bar. Hooray, the structure finally moves!

6. Apps, Models, Controllers for NTRTsim using YAML
