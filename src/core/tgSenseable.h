 * This class defines methods for use with sensors.
 * If an object (really, mostly just tgModel and its descendants) can be sensed,
 * inherit from this class and re-define ALL the methods.
 * Note that we make everything pure virtual here to force re-definition.
 * Sensing data from objects occurs in two places in the NTRTsim workflow.
 * First, when setting up the simulation, a heading for the data is given.
 * This describes the data that will be returned, in a comma-separated-value form.
 * Second, when the simulation is running, the data itself can be taken.
 * Note that it's up to the caller (e.g., a tgDataLogger2) to match up the headings
 * with the data.
