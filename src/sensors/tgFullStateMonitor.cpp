    // ON 2017-11-05:
    // Major bugs, so this class is not used. Three main issues:

    // (1) Substructures in YAML are not being tagged the way I want.
    // For example, the rods within 't1' need to have 't1' as a tag, not just 'rod'.
    // Maybe, instead of (in addition to?) tagging compounded bodies according
    // to the hash I did, use the substructure name from YAML also.

    // (2) Structures are being presented out-of-order. This is kind of expected,
    // I guess, since it has to do with the randomness of the tags that are
    // assigned to the compound rigid bodies. However, we need consistent ordering
    // for the state vector that's being returned (the components need to refer
    // to the same rigid bodies from one run to the next!!!). So, we'd really need
    // to index by some externally defined name, not just alphabetize by compound
    // hash, since compound hash changes each time.

    // (3) BIGGEST BUG: not all compound bodies are sensed!!!! Or, maybe tags
    // aren't assigned to all compounded bodies. Example: run this with
    // AppLaikaWalkingDRL, and see that the number of sensors changes from 7, to 8,
    // to 9 seemingly randomly. There should always be 9 sensors.
    // However - this is probably more a problem with tgCompoundRigidSensor and its
    // friends, since the same "missing sensors" actually seems to happen with
    // tgDataLogger2 for the same App. Did Robel's code drop sensors like this?
