 * Then, this class has a method to query the state at any time, independent
 * of onStep or anything from the tgSimulation.
 *
 * Think of this class as the "state" part of state-feedback control.
 * As of 2017-11-05, this class will be designed for only rigid body tgModels:
 * - rods
 * - compound rigids
 * ...all others are ignored (so, in essence, this is a "Full Rigid Body State" monitor.
