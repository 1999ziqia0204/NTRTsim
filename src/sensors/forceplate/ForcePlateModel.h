/**
 * This tgModel creates a 'force plate' that can sense forces in x, y, and z.
 * It creates a frame structure with a separate plate in the middle, and a
 * series of springs supporting it around the sides and bottom.
 * These springs (should) have a high stiffness, so that when a force is
 * applied to the plate, the plate moves a very small distance, and then
 * the force can be back-calculated through the deflection of the springs.
 * To use this model, be sure to choose appropriate dimensions and spring
 * constants. The spring constant and coefficient
 * of damping will need to be chosen based on the types of forces that should
 * be sensed, so run tests with different parameters to see what works best.
 * See the PDF document, and Solidworks model, that accompany this file
 * (called NTRT Force Plate) for a graphical view of all the dimensions.
 * In order to take data using this force plate, a tgDataObserver/Logger must
 * be attached to this model.
