/**
 * This tgModel creates a 'force plate' that can sense forces in x, y, and z.
 * It creates a frame structure with a separate plate in the middle, and a
 * series of springs supporting it around the sides and bottom.
 * These springs (should) have a high stiffness, so that when a force is
 * applied to the plate, the plate moves a very small distance, and then
 * the force can be back-calculated through the deflection of the springs.
 * To use this model, be sure to choose appropriate dimensions and spring
 * constants. The spring constant and coefficient
 * of damping will need to be chosen based on the types of forces that should
 * be sensed, so run tests with different parameters to see what works best.
 * See the PDF document, and Solidworks model, that accompany this file
 * (called NTRT Force Plate) for a graphical view of all the dimensions.
 * In order to take data using this force plate, a tgDataObserver/Logger must
 * be attached to this model.

     * the cpp file.
     * The 'constructor' for this struct assigns variables if they're passed in,
     * otherwise, defaults are chosen.
     * Unlike with some of the other models, such as tgSpringCable Actuator,
     * where abbreviations are used for the dummy variables and longer names
     * are used for the actual variables in the struct, this is reversed:
     * since there will be a LOT of calculations using these names, typing out
     * a whole word will be very cumbersome as I'm writing this class.
     * Just use this class in the same way as done with the demo, and it should
     * work fine. 
     *
     * This model also takes a vector as input, below, specifying the location of
     * the center of the bottom of the housing. This is preferable to taking
     * two points like a tgBox, since that would involve validating that the 
     * two points were along a horizontal line (this class will not support 
     * force plates at angles, at least for now.)
     *
     * So, the config struct is for parameters related to the actual construction,
     * not the location, of the force plate.
