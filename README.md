Branch apopescu
========
This branch contains work on deployment vizualization with more accurate SUPERball collision models than just cylindrical rods, e.g. the motors and endcaps are modeled. These additional geometrical components are important for the packing/unpacking problem. In addition, various tgX objects (tgRod, tgSphere, tgBox), are modified so you can add _colors_ to your visualization!
